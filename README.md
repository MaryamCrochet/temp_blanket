# temp_blanket
simulate your temperature blanket based on your location

Work in progress. The idea is to create a web page where you could enter your location and it would give you the temperatures of last year to give you an idea of what your blanket will look like. It would automatically calculate what intervalls you have to use according to how many colors you want. Then you could change the colors and see how that would look. And finally download the result as a pdf or something
